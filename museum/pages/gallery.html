        <p class="info__paragraph">Some artworks have survived over the centuries
          and made such a mark on history that we cannot imagine the world without them.
          Their influence has spread across borders and cultures,
          and to this day they continue to be distinguished by experts and admired by all.
          Where better than the Louvre to get a sense of these great artworks?
          The palace is home to some of the world’s most iconic pieces – paintings,
          sculptures, architectural elements and art objects
          by famous or anonymous artists of many different origins and eras.
          And no two masterpieces are alike!

              So beautiful that Venus, the goddess of beauty, was furiously jealous of her.
              She ordered her son, Cupid, to punish the young girl.

              and later even brought her back to life with a kiss.
              This is the moment Canova chose to depict.

              from the collection of Greek sculptures – particularly statues of gods, 
              goddesses and mythological heroes.Some of the works presented here are actually Roman
              marble copies of Greek bronze originals, as very few large Greek bronzes have survived.
              This is the case with the graceful Artemis with a Doe, in the middle of the room.
              This marble sculpture from the 2nd century BC was based on a bronze original
              made in about 330 BC. It is also known as the Diana of Versailles,
              as it used to adorn the Hall of Mirrors at the Château de Versailles.

            <p class="article__description">Michelangelo's slaves were made for the tombstone
              of Pope Julius II, who died in 1513. However, the Pope's successors foun
               this ambitious project too costly. So, Michelangelo presented two
               statues to his friend Roberto Strozzi, a Florentine in exile at the
               French court. Strozzi, in turn, handed them over to King François I.
               For two hundred years, the monument passed from hands to hands
               of the French nobility, until they were seized during the French Revolution
               and came to the Louvre in 1794.

              rare Greek statues whose exact original location is known. It was made as an
              offering to the gods for a sanctuary on the Greek island of Samothrace. Placed
              at a height, people could see her from afar. That is why, in a nod to her
              original lofty home, she now adorns the top of the Daru staircase. Nike, the
              winged goddess who heralds victory, is seen just as she is about to alight on a ship.

              (now called Milos), where she was found in 1820 and acquired almost
              immediately by the Marquis de Rivière, the French ambassador to Greece at that
              time. He then presented her to King Louis XVIII, who donated her to the Louvre
              in March 1821. In barely two years, the Venus had moved from the shadows to
              the light.

            <p class="article__description">This is the most famous portrait in the world.
              It shows Lisa Gherardini, wife of the Florentine silk merchant Francesco de
               Giocondo – hence her Italian name La Gioconda and her French name La Joconde.
               Painted against a distant landscape, she stares out at us with her famously
               enigmatic smile...but another aspect of the painting that makes it so special
               is Leonardo da Vinci’s sfumato technique, based on the use of glazes to create
               a ‘smoky’ effect with subtle contours and contrasts. Leonardo captured the
               sitter turning towards the viewer in a natural movement that brings the
               painting to life.

            <p class="article__description">The first project of Visconti and Trélat in 1848,
              criticized the architects for not having provided sufficient access to the
              galleries of the new buildings in the south wing. Visconti, in the project
              adopted in 1852, will therefore double by a symmetrical staircase in the
              Mollien pavilion the old staircase of the Museum of Percier and Fontaine.
              Lefuel will demolish it, of which he will keep only the upper landing in 1856,
              to replace it with a monumental staircase, the Daru staircase, completed only
              in 1932. The shell of the Mollien staircase was built in 1853-54 and the
              decoration studied by Lefuel in 1855-56, but the site was abandoned and
              resumed in 1869. The decoration of the upper parts was then completed, but the
              whole of the he staircase was not completed by Blavette until June 1914.

              depicted breaking through a barricade. The female figure at the top of the

            <p class="article__description">This painting is mentioned for the first time,
              with almost certainty, in 1642 at the Château de Fontainebleau. It probably
              entered the French royal collections earlier, perhaps as early as the reign
              of Louis XII or that of François Ier.

            <p class="article__name">"Ieoh Ming Pei - The Pyramid"</p>
            <p class="article__description">On your way through the Salle du Manège,
              look through the glass door to the famous Pyramid which sparked such
              controversy in the press and the National Assembly during its construction
              between 1985 and 1989. Some feared the venerable palace would be transfigured
              beyond repair… but in fact, the project followed in an 800 year-old
              tradition of architectural transformations, such as the demolition of a 30
              metre-high keep that once stood at the heart of the medieval fortress. I.M.
              Pei’s Pyramid – a mere 19 metres in height – was inspired in part by the
              geometry of the Tuileries Garden, and the Chinese-born American architect
              chose the clearest possible glass to ensure that the buildings of his
              predecessors would remain perfectly visible.
